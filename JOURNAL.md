# July 31: whole project
Started out the project today since today is the last day of highway and i wanted to ship more stuff. found out this while doom-scrolling thourgh youtube, and decided to go ahead with this.
thb, asked AI (perplexity) for help with the wriing, diagram, the kind of compoennts required. firmware was open-source scrolling firmware for a rotary encoder, whichi would edit after assembling the whole thing.

basically did the following:

- finding components
- finding some open-suorce firmware for initial prototype, which i would edit soon
